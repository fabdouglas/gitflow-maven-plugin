# Git-Flow Maven Plugin

[![Maven Central](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/com.amashchenko.maven.plugin/gitflow-maven-plugin/badge.svg?subject=Maven Central)](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/com.amashchenko.maven.plugin/gitflow-maven-plugin/)

The Maven plugin for Vincent Driessen's [successful Git branching model](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/).

Currently a Java implementation of Git version control system [JGit](https://github.com/eclipse/jgit) doesn't support [`.gitattributes`](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Customizing-Git-Git-Attributes).

This plugin runs Git and Maven commands from the command line ensuring that all Git features work properly.

# Eclipse Plugins build with Tycho

Since version `1.1.0` this plugin supports Eclipse plugin projects which are build with [Tycho](https://eclipse.org/tycho/).
To enable this feature put `<tychoBuild>true</tychoBuild>` into `<configuration>` section of this plugin in your pom.xml file.

### Features of `tychoBuild`

The [`tycho-versions-plugin`](https://eclipse.org/tycho/sitedocs/tycho-release/tycho-versions-plugin/plugin-info.html) Maven plugin will be used to set versions instead of [`versions-maven-plugin`](http://www.mojohaus.org/versions-maven-plugin/).

Feature name will not be appended to project version on `gitflow:feature-start` goal even if the `skipFeatureVersion` is set to `false`.

If version has qualifier then it will not be removed in the release or hotfix goals.


# Plugin Common Parameters

All parameters are optional. The `gitFlowConfig` parameters defaults are the same as in below example.
Maven and Git executables are assumed to be in the PATH, if executables are not available in the PATH or you want to use different version use `mvnExecutable` and `gitExecutable` parameters.
The `goals` and `arguments` parameter controls whether the Maven goals will be called during the mojo execution at the end of the `-start` mojos and at the middle of `release` mojo. By default, nothing is done.
Since `1.0.7` version of this plugin the output of the executed commands will NOT be printed into the console. This can be changed by setting `verbose` parameter to `true`.

    <configuration>
        <mvnExecutable>path_to_maven_executable</mvnExecutable>
        <gitExecutable>path_to_git_executable</gitExecutable>

        <goals>clean deploy</goals>
        <arguments>-Pminify -Dfoo=bar</arguments>
        <verbose>false</verbose>

        <gitFlowConfig>
            <productionBranch>master</productionBranch>
            <developmentBranch>develop</developmentBranch>
            <featureBranchPrefix>feature/</featureBranchPrefix>
            <releaseBranchPrefix>release/</releaseBranchPrefix>
            <hotfixBranchPrefix>hotfix/</hotfixBranchPrefix>
            <supportBranchPrefix>support/</supportBranchPrefix>
            <versionTagPrefix></versionTagPrefix>
        </gitFlowConfig>

        <commitMessages>
            <!-- since 1.2.1, see Customizing commit messages -->
        </commitMessages>
    </configuration>

## Customizing commit messages

Since `1.2.1` commit messages can be changed in plugin's configuration section in pom.xml. Commit messages defaults are seen below.

    <configuration>
        <commitMessages>
            <featureStartMessage>updating versions for feature branch</featureStartMessage>
            <featureFinishMessage>updating versions for development branch</featureFinishMessage>

            <hotfixStartMessage>updating versions for hotfix</hotfixStartMessage>
            <hotfixFinishMessage>updating for next development version</hotfixFinishMessage>

            <releaseStartMessage>updating versions for release</releaseStartMessage>
            <releaseFinishMessage>updating for next development version</releaseFinishMessage>

            <tagHotfixMessage>tagging hotfix</tagHotfixMessage>
            <tagReleaseMessage>tagging release</tagReleaseMessage>
        </commitMessages>
    </configuration>

Maven properties can be used in commit messages. For example `<featureStartMessage>updating ${artifactId} project for feature branch</featureStartMessage>` will produce message where
`${artifactId}` will be substituted for projects `<artifactId>`.

Note that although `${project.version}` can be used any changes to version introduced by this goal won't be reflected in a commit message for this goal.

## Additional goal parameters

The `gitflow:release-finish`, `gitflow:release` and `gitflow:hotfix-finish` goals have `skipTag` parameter. This parameter controls whether the release/hotfix will be tagged in Git.
The default value is `false` (i.e. the release/hotfix will be tagged).

The `gitflow:feature-start` goal has `skipFeatureVersion` parameter which controls whether the feature name will be appended to the project version or not.
The default value is `false` (e.g. if the project version is `1.0.0-SNAPSHOT` and feature name is `feature_name` then after the execution it will be `1.0.0-feature_name-SNAPSHOT`).

All `-finish` goals have `keepBranch` parameter which controls whether created support branch will be kept in Git after the goal finishes.
The default value is `false` (i.e. the supporting branch will be deleted).

All `-finish` goals and `gitflow:release` have `skipTestProject` parameter which controls whether Maven `test` goal will be called before merging branches.
The default value is `false` (i.e. the project will be tested before merging branches).

All `release` goals have `allowSnapshots` parameter which controls whether SNAPSHOT dependencies are allowed. The default value is `false` (i.e. build fails if there SNAPSHOT dependency in project).

### Rebase, Merge, Fast Forward, Squash

Release branch can be rebased instead of merged by setting `releaseRebase` parameter to `true`. The default value is `false` (i.e. merge will be performed).

Release branch can be merged without `--no-ff` option by setting `releaseMergeNoFF` parameter to `false`. The default value is `true` (i.e. merge --no-ff will be performed).
The `releaseMergeNoFF` parameter has no effect when `releaseRebase` parameter is set to `true`.

Feature branch can be squashed before merging by setting `featureSquash` parameter to `true`. The default value is `false` (i.e. merge w/o squash will be performed).

# Non-interactive Release

Releases could be performed without prompting for the release version during `gitflow:release-start` goal by telling Maven to run in non-interactive (batch) mode.
When `gitflow:release-start` is executed in the Maven batch mode the default release version will be used.

To put Maven in the batch mode use `-B` or `--batch-mode` option.

    mvn -B gitflow:release-start gitflow:release-finish

To release w/o creating separate release branch use `gitflow:release` goal.

    mvn -B gitflow:release

This gives the ability to perform releases in non-interactive mode (e.g. in CI server).
